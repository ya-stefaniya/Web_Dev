# Web_Dev
Simple one-page site with no js.

The key is feature is matching the layout.
This is achieved by matching two images while overlaying using the PerfectPixel browser extension.
Layout is taken from [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/2Zev0HVCKABbZoAsuWTdcD/webdev_newVersion(19.09)?node-id=1%3A5)

  * The main blocks must be exactly located on the given screen width (1600px) according to the overlay image, except for the Subscribe block.
  * Images, logos are located within a logical container with the correct approach to centering and positioning. 
  * Deviations from the layout are possible for the sake of a grid or column structure.
  * Icons should maintain an ideal distance to the start of their respective text.
